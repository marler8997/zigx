# XLFD: X Logical Font Description

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_logical_font_description#:~:text=One%20prominent%20XLFD%20convention%20is,FAMILY_NAME%3A%20Typeface%20family


14 fields.


Given a set of fonts, how do you create a useful set of filters?

1. Every field value should have a "number" associated that represents how many fonts have that field value.
2. Every "filtered field"


You should be able to select a field value and only include or exclude all fonts with that value.
    The UI for every field value should indicate how many fonts will remain if it is used.

    Field: WEIGHT_NAME
    Filter: [X] Inclusive(100) [ ] Exclusive(20)
    [X] medium(100)
    [ ] bold(20)

    Note that all values are either inclusive or exclusive, you cannot mix both.  The UI should have some way of switching this?






You should be able to remove a filter, 

1. Do all fonts share the same fields?
